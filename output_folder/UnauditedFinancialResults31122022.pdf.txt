A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries primarily with company personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion: 4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34 as prescribed under section 133 of the Act and other recognised accounting practices and policies generally accepted in India has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations including circulars issued by SEBI from time to time in this regard, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
