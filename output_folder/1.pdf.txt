We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results of Kirloskar Brothers Limited (the "Company") for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2024, together with notes thereon (the "Statement") being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the Company's Board of Directors on 29 October 2024, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (the "Act"), read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other recognised accounting practices and policies generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations including circulars issued by SEBI from time to time in this regard. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. Scope of review: 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries primarily with company personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 145(10) ot the Act and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express, ran@n 4, audit opinion. . %is Ahmedabad I Bengaluru I Chennai I Coimbatore I Delhi !

Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34 as prescribed under section 133 of the Act and other recognised accounting practices and policies generally accepted in India has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations including circulars issued by SEBI from time to time in this regard, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.  d CA Pramod Bhise Partner Membership No.:(F) 047751 UDIN: 24047751BKABAH6531 Sharp & Tannan Associates Chartered Accountants ICAI Firm Reg.
