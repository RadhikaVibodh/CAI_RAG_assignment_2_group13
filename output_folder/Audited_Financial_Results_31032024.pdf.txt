We have audited the accompanying statement of standalone financial results of Kirloskar Brothers Limited (the "Company") for the quarter and year ended 31 March 2024 together with notes thereon (the "Statement") being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us these Statement; A. are presented in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations in this regard; and 8. gives a true and fair view in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the applicable Indian Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India of the net profit, other comprehensive income and other financial information of the Company for the quarter and year ended 31 March 2024. Basis for opinion 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing ("SAs") specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Statement under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAl's Code of Ethics.

( @ Z S { > Management's and Board of Directors' responsibilities for the Statement 4. The Statement has been prepared on the basis of the standalone financial statements. The Company's management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Statement that give a true and fair view of the net profit, other comprehensive income and other financial information in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34, prescribed under Section 733 of the Act read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 5. In preparing the Statement, the Company's management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Statement 7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Statement. 8. As part of an audit inaccordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: A. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  ew {w /ct ' , t j KBL SFS AR 31March 2024  .

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) ( ) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. C. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. D. Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. E. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the financial results represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 9. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements. 70. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 11. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in "Other Matter" paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide abasis for our opinion. Management's and Board of Director's responsibilities for the Statement 4. The Statement has been prepared on the basis of consolidated financial statements. The Holding Company's management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Statement that give a true and fair view of the consolidated total comprehensive income (comprising of net profit and other comprehensive income) and other financial information of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The respective management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and its associates and joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Statement as aforesaid. 5. In preparing the Statement, the respective Management and Board of Directors of companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Companies included in the group, its associates and joint ventures or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6.

S y D ccoy not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Ss will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Statement. 8. As part of an audit inaccordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: A. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. B. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we arc also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group, its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern. E. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. F. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial results/financial information (separate/consolidated) of the entities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to express an opinion on the Statement. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information of such entities included in the Statement of which we are the independent auditors.
